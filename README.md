### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ My name is [Nitin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinjs/). I am a web developer.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working with startups, SME businesses and entrepreneurs build their own apps. I am professional and handle everything from 'spec-out' the app to performing the QA, and making sure that it's launched and hosted on a website. I am totally communicative and I have references available upon request.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently learning IoT-Electronics, Arduino and .NET MAUI

ðŸ“« Ask me about how to contact yourself in the futureðŸ˜œ. [Send](mailto:nitin@nitinsawant.com) me an email or connect on [Skype](https://join.skype.com/vf00tYHEXShb) to schedule a consultation.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and feel. That is the Purpose of LIFE.
