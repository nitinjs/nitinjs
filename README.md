### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ My name is [Nitin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinjs/). I am a web developer.

ðŸ‘¯ I now work with startups, SME businesses and entrepreneurs build their own apps. I am professional and handle everything from 'spec-out' the app to performing the QA, and making sure that it's launched and hosted on a website. I am totally communicative and I have references available upon request.

ðŸ’¬ [Send](mailto:nitin@nitinsawant.com) me an email or connect on [Skype](https://join.skype.com/vf00tYHEXShb) to schedule a consultation or you want to know how to contact yourself in the future ðŸ˜œ.
